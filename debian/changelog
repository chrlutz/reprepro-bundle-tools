reprepro-bundle-tools (0.5.0) bionic; urgency=medium

  Bundle-Compose-App:
  * authentication and session-support
  * better performance
  * added license headers
  * implemented caching for the git changelog
  * bundle/bundle-compose: apt-repos call with fall back to apt-repos version installed on the system
  * added encrypted credential transmission between frontend and backend.
    NOTE: this encryption doesn't protect the transmission itself,
    it is aimed to protect the credential in the storage - which means
    that neither frontend nor backend remember all required parts to
    restore the secret for a long time.

  Reprepro-Bundle-Tools:
  * introduced hooks
  * better sanity checks for ./bundle
  * bundle: new switches --no-info and --no-upgrade-keep-section to prevent section changes during package updates
  * bundle-compose: put update-rules in separate lines within the distributions-file
  * introduced creation of 'dynamic-distibutions' file to separate static and dynamic parts of a target repo configuration
  * bundle: added new switch 'bundle ls -w â€¦' to do some active waiting for server-changes
  * changed columns order for apr-repos output in './bundle ls/show' and trac ticket creation
  * ...and even more improvements and bug-fixes

  Drafts for a new debian package apt-add-bundle

  Build-System:
  * introduced a docker based buildsystem for ad hoc builds and debian-builds
