reprepro-bundle-tools (0.6.0) bionic; urgency=medium

  [ Christoph Lutz ]
  * fixed and clarified from where to get bundle-compose config files
  * debian-build: do the more restrictive 'make -C test returncodes'
  * bundle: using branch 'master' as default branch
  * bundle: explicitely set workingDir instead of usind chdir()
    this also fixes a bug with cmd_init in which repos-config was
    created for the wrong workingDir (and e.g. with an not updated git repo
    state)
    this also fixes a bug with cmd_clone in which not all configuration
    files were created - leading to a dirty git after './bundle apply' apply
    on the server.
  * renamed trac ticket type 'Betriebsübernahme' to 'Betriebsuebernahme'
  * bundle-compose-app: styling-improvements and UX
    - clarified meaning of the symbol shown with the trac-status
    - nicer display of the branch-name
    - show cloned GIT-Repository as link if the repo-url starts with 'http'
  * ng new ng-bundle-compose-viewer
  * added Makefile, gitignores and projects.symlink
  * 'make clean install' changed package-lock.json
  * ng generate library managed-bundle-lib; make clean install
  * fixed vulnerability: npm install --save-dev @angular/compiler-cli@7.2.10; make clean install
  * fixed vulnerability: npm install --save-dev karma@4.0.1; make clean install
  * npm install --dev typescript@'>=3.1.1 <3.3'; make clean install
  * Building angular for local usage with 'ng build --base-href ./'
  * npm install --save bootstrap jquery popper.js; make clean install
  * npm install --save font-awesome; make clean install
  * added symlinks for bootstrap and fontawesome and imported them to index.html
  * using 'npm ci' instead of 'npm install' is more what we intend to do
  * bundle-compose: added subcommand 'jsondump'
  * tmp
  * viewer: started with the search feature
  * jsondump also contains field 'ticket' now
  * styling fixes and counter
  * Visibility-Control for status, dist and target
  * added select-filter
  * updated example data
  * Revert "ng generate library managed-bundle-lib; make clean install"
    This reverts commit 306bfc2c905a0d054e8b8ab6e146c2f26af652ea.
  * added 'make prod' and removed unwanted console.log() line
  * added README.txt which hints to the sources
  * let 'make prod' create the bundle-compose-viewer.tgz file
  * projects symlink no longer needed for ng-bundle-compose-viewer
  * added icons for ng-bundle-compose-viewer
  * added 'make prod' for building all production artefacts at once and using 'npm ci' everywhere
  * using --prod --aot=false --build-optimizer=false for production build for ng-bundle and ng-bundle-compose.
    This is required because ExtraAuthModalComponent is dynamically loaded
    and can't be correctly resolved with aot-builds.
  * switched shared lib to use ngx-simple-modal instead of the badly maintained ng2-bootstrap-modal
  * npm updates and fixes for ng-bundle and ng-bundle-compose
    - bundle-compose: npm install @angular-devkit/build-ng-packagr
      (required for shared module)
    - both: replaced ng2-bootstrap-modal by ngx-simple-modal
    - both: ng-bundle-compose: npm update; npm audit fix
  * Ask for username interactively if not provided in config
  * correct quoting of several url parts (and user credentials)
  * ng generate library bundle-auth
  * moved auth parts to new library bundle-auth
  * integrated bundle-dialog.service into authentication.service and other refactoring fixes
  * referring new lib bundle-auth from ng-bundle-compose
  * ng-bundle can be built with full optimizations in --prod now since bundle-auth & dynamic modal dialogs are moved to unused lib bundle-auth
  * added shared project to ng-bundle-compose-viewer
  * replaced shared select-filter by better select-filter from ng-bundle-compose-viewer
  * ng-bundle-compose-viewer: using new shared select-filter now
  * ng-bundle: using new shared select-filter now
  * ng-bundle-compose: added missing build dependency for 'make prod'
  * ng-bundle-compose: using new shared select-filter now
  * select-filter: only show number of selected elements if there's a number

  * bundle-compose-viewer: added Routing, QueryParams-Evaluation for 'bid' and corresponding routerLink
  * bundle-compose-viewer: just warn in case bundle-deps.json is not there
  * bundle-compose-viewer: added 'show only independent bundles' select filter
  * bundle-compose: more messages during updateBundles and unified output language to (what I think it could be) English
  * bundle-compose-app: create routerLinks for bundles mentioned in logging messages
  * bundle-compose-app: improved log messages and ensured that bundle-ids are single words in log messages
  * using super instead of this - just looks nicer
  * unified Status-Badges between bundle-info-card (ng-bundle-compose-viewer) and managed-bundle-editor (ng-bundle-compose)
  * bundle-compose-app: implemented new 'Ignores: TargetFromInfoFile' flag in the backend and the frontend
  * fixed tests for Uppercase Statuses now
  * keep and ensure lowercase letters in bundle-compose.status
  * bundle-compose-app: provide more bundle infos - SourcesList, RepoUrl and InfoFileUrl
  * bundle-compose-app: load bundleInfos more lazy and in background chunks
  * ng-frontends: fixed 'Epression has changed after it was checked' messages due to illegal 'ngFor with maps' in select-filter component
  * removed unwanted console.log line
  * ng-bundle-compose: using 'undefined' and 'null' instead of ManagedBundleInfo constants and marked bundles without apt-repos suite
  * bundle-compose-app: using card-deck instead of card-column
  * bundle-compose-app: fixed broken selections for distributions and targets
  * ng-bundle-libs: moved 'parseBundleId to new file bundle-utils.ts
  * bundle-compose-app: added search bar for bundle- and ticket numbers
  * bundle-compose: passing ParentTicket field from the info-file to the created Ticket

  * bundle-compose-app: fixed and bundle search and inmproved representation of search result
  * ng-frontends: better solution for fixed equal height cards in a card-decks
  * bundle-compose: reworked creation of repo/target config files

    rm package-lock.json
    npm i
    npm audit fix
    npm audit fix --force
    npm audit
    npm install typescript@">=3.1.1 <3.3"

  * bundle-compose: implemented subcommand jsondeps
  * bundle-compose-viewer: show dependencies with more details and as a list
  * bundle-compose-viewer: added 'Show only latest Replacements' feature
  * bundle-compose: more complex example of trac.api usage (parent -> umgesetzte_tickets)

reprepro-bundle-tools (0.5.0) bionic; urgency=medium

  Bundle-Compose-App:
  * authentication and session-support
  * better performance
  * added license headers
  * implemented caching for the git changelog
  * bundle/bundle-compose: apt-repos call with fall back to apt-repos version installed on the system
  * added encrypted credential transmission between frontend and backend.
    NOTE: this encryption doesn't protect the transmission itself,
    it is aimed to protect the credential in the storage - which means
    that neither frontend nor backend remember all required parts to
    restore the secret for a long time.

  Reprepro-Bundle-Tools:
  * introduced hooks
  * better sanity checks for ./bundle
  * bundle: new switches --no-info and --no-upgrade-keep-section to prevent section changes during package updates
  * bundle-compose: put update-rules in separate lines within the distributions-file
  * introduced creation of 'dynamic-distibutions' file to separate static and dynamic parts of a target repo configuration
  * bundle: added new switch 'bundle ls -w …' to do some active waiting for server-changes
  * changed columns order for apr-repos output in './bundle ls/show' and trac ticket creation
  * ...and even more improvements and bug-fixes

  Drafts for a new debian package apt-add-bundle

  Build-System:
  * introduced a docker based buildsystem for ad hoc builds and debian-builds
