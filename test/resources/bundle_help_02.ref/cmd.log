                   bundleName

Subcommand init: Reserves a new bundle ID and creates a new empty bundle for
the given distribution

positional arguments:
  bundleName            The bundleName is a value in the format
                        <distribution>[/<bundleID>] that points to the path in
                        the folder repo/bundle/ in which the bundle is stored.
                        Is is possible to just provide the <distribution>
                        part. In this case, there will be a new bundle (with a
                        newly incremented bundleID) created for this
                        distribution. To support command line completion, it
                        is also allowed to specify the full path relative to
                        the projects root in the form
                        repo/bundle/<distribution>[/<bundleID>].

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --own-suite OWN_SUITE
                        Suite-Selectors that defines the own suite (the suite
                        of this bundle). The default value is
                        'bundle:{bundle}'.

advanced suites control parameters:
  --no-apt-update       Skip download of packages list.
  --supplier-suites SUPPLIER_SUITES
                        Comma separated list of Suite-Selectors that define
                        the supplier-suites to track. The default value is
                        '{distribution}-supplier:,user-{user}:{distribution}'.
  --reference-suites REFERENCE_SUITES
                        Comma separated list of Suite-Selectors that define
                        the reference suites which hold the current state that
                        we refer on. The default value is
                        '{distribution}-reference:,bundle:{bundle}'.
  --highlighted-suites HIGHLIGHTED_SUITES
                        Comma separated list of Suite-Selectors that define
                        suites whose entries should be put on top of the
                        sources_control.list. The default value is
                        'bundle:{bundle}'.

additional arguments for git-commit management:
  --commit              Commit changed files to the (local) project git-
                        repository.
  --no-clean-commit     The subcommands 'init' and 'clone' implicitely behave
                        as if --clean-commit was set. This means that a clone
                        of the current git-repository into a temporary folder
                        is created and changes are automatically commited
                        there and pushed back to the server immediately. This
                        is done to ensure that new bundleId's are immediately
                        synced to the server! Use --no-clean-commit to disable
                        this default. With --no-clean-commit this tool would
                        operate on the local project folder without any
                        commits.
  --git-repo-url GIT_REPO_URL
                        GIT-Repository URL used to clone the repository during
                        --clean-commit. Per default the current git tracking
                        branch is used (if set).
  --git-branch GIT_BRANCH
                        GIT-Repository branch used to pull and push during
                        --clean-commit. The default is 'test'.
